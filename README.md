## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM
- Logical Properties

### What I learned

This solution was my second submission to this challenge, more than learning I reinforced my knowledge.
I'm happy with how I improved my skills along the way, the journey is still long of course, but when you look back and you touch the improvement there are only three things to do:
- To be proud of themselves ðŸ¥²
- Keep learning ðŸ“–
- Keep coding ðŸ’»

### Continued development

Like this project, by the next one, I'll be focused on CSS Grid, Flexbox, Fluid typography, Fluid spacing, Custom properties and how to build responsive layouts without using media queries.
